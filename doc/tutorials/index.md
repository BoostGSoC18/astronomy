# Astronomy library

## **Introduction**

Development of Astronomy library started as a part Google Summer of Code 2018 under mentor organization **Boost C++ Library** and mentor/guide **Vinícius dos Santos Oliveira**. 

This library provides basic functionalities which are required daily in the field of astronomy.

**Scope of this library:**
 1. Coordinate system
 2. FITS file handling 

 We are planning to expand this in the future to support more features.

## Prerequisites
* Minimum C++11 is required
* Familiarity with the boost.geometry (recommended but not necessary)
* Knowledge of the coordinate system
* Knowledge of File handling with C++
* Knowledge of C++ templates

## Limitations
* In this version, units are not supported with the coordinate system but will be added soon
* Limited functionality for FITS file

## **Index**

2. FITS File Handling
    * 2.1 Reading FITS
        * 2.1.1 Accessing headers
        * 2.1.1 Accessing data
